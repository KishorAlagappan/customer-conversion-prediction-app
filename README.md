# `Customer_Conversion_Prediction`
**Project Description:** Customer Conversion Prediction

I undertook a project focused on customer conversion prediction. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately classify potential customers based on various features and predict their likelihood of conversion. This project allowed me to apply my skills in data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and programming to solve real-world problems.

**`Key-Points`**

1. I gained a basic understanding of the data to familiarize myself with its structure, variables, and relationships.

2. I performed data cleaning to make the raw data more usable for analysis. I identified and handled missing values, duplicates, and other data inconsistencies during this process.

3. I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the data. This helped me identify patterns, relationships, and potential variables for analysis.

4. I prepared the data for model training and testing through data preprocessing. I encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. I used data sampling techniques, to address class imbalance and improve the model's performance.

6. I trained the model using different machine learning algorithms, to classify potential customers and predict their likelihood of conversion.

7. I performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of my models.

8. I evaluated the performance of my models and achieved a high AUROC score of 96.5% with the XGBoost model, indicating its effectiveness in classifying the target variable. The Random Forest model achieved an AUROC score of around 96%, slightly lower than XGBoost.

9. Based on the high AUROC scores achieved, it is recommended to consider deploying either the XGBoost or Random Forest model in the production environment to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

## `Results`

Through this project, I successfully developed a customer conversion prediction model with high accuracy. The XGBoost model achieved an AUROC score of 96.5%, indicating its effectiveness in classifying potential customers. The Random Forest model also showed promise with an AUROC score of around 96%. These models can accurately target potential customers and optimize marketing costs, providing valuable insights to improve marketing campaigns.

This project enhanced my skills and ability to handle real-world datasets, build predictive models, and communicate the results effectively.
